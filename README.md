# Selection Tools
Tools to draw areas and make selections

## Installing

This package is provided through OpenUPM, to install it using the CLI you can perform the following:

```bash
$ openupm add selection-tools
```

or, you have to add `https://package.openupm.com` as a scoped registry with, at least, the following scopes:

- `eu.netherlands3d`

## Usage
See samples package for examples. This needs the main Netherlands3D package because it still makes use of the event system. This will be fixed in a future release

# Repository Archived

This repository has been **archived** and is no longer maintained independently.

The contents of this package have been merged into the  
**[Netherlands3D Main Repository](https://github.com/Netherlands3D/twin)**  
into the `Packages` folder.

## Current Location

The latest version and future updates of this package will be maintained inside the Netherlands3D main repository as part of an effort to simplify and unify our development workflow.

## Why was this repository archived?

To streamline development and reduce overhead, the Netherlands3D packages are being integrated into the main repository.  
This approach allows for better coordination between packages and features, while we continue to evaluate whether a full monorepo setup (including versioning) is desirable in the future.

## Publication status

Updates to this package on **OpenUPM** are **suspended until further notice**.
